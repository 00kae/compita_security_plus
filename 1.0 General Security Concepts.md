## General Security Concepts (12%) Objectives
- 1.1 Compare and Contrast various types of security controls.
- 1.2 Summarize Fundamental Security concepts.
- 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security
- 1.4 Explain the importance of using appropriate cryptographic solutions

* Based on the practice exams, best you focus on all the examples for each category of security controls and what they are. Be able to explain them well.
* First try for [practice exam 1](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia-security-plus-practice-test-1-exam-sy0-701) was 71%)

### 1.1 Security Controls 
Security Controls are used to mitigate against attacks. There are 3 main types: Technical, Manegerial/Admin, and Physical
#### Categories
- Technical
  - These security controls are administered by IT, and some big examples would be firewalls, antivirus, antimalware, screensavers, and screen filters. These are security controls that are implemented on the technical level. Firewalls in particular prevents unauthorized access to the network by
    blocking certain IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An example would be blocking 10.10.10.10 from gaining access to your network.
- Managerial
    - These security controls are implemented by higher positioned employees such as managers, in order to reduce risk in the company. Managers can assign mandatory annual security awareness meetings to decrease the chances of a security attack. This ties in with the idea that security is only as strong
      as the weakest link. Other examples would be pentesting and vulnerability scanning, which intrusively scans for vulnerabilities. Risk assessment and changing management also ties in with managerial security controls.
- Operational
    - I don't believe this was touched in the 501 exam, so this seems relatively new. Regardless it has been popping up in the TryHackMe AoC2024 challenge so that's fun that it's here on the exam as well. Also known as OPSEC, it is coined by the [US Marine Corps](https://www.mcieast.marines.mil/opsec/) , and are methods used to identify, control, and protect sensitive information.
      There are 5 steps to this process and is to be repeated.
      - Identifying critical and sensitive data
      - Analyzing the threat
      - Determining the vulnerabilities
      - Assessing the risk
      - Developing and implementing countermeasures
    - I believe that Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and least privilege are to be applied in Operantional security controls. Determining the vulnerabilities means accesssing how much damage can be done to a nation via MAC. Least privilege, as implied, gives a person the most limited access in order to just be able to do their job and nothing more. They will
      not have the ability to abuse it. I learned this in my Security class :)
  - These are controls implemented by people, not computers, such as security guards and awareness programs.
- Physical
  - Very obviously, chains, locks, walls. Anything of a physical barrier between what is to be attacked and the attacker. Biometrics, burglar alarms, airgaps, and bollards. There are also deterrent controls, such as montion detection cameras. They will be categorized as Deterrent controls. 
#### Control Types
- Preventive
    - Blocks access to resource
    - 
- Deterrent
    - Discourage intrusion attempts; does not directly prevent an attack
    - Posted warning signs
    - Threat of demotion
    - Splash screens
- Detective
    - Identify/log intrusion attempts; does not directly prevent attacks/access
    - Review system logs
    - Review login reports
    - CCTV
- Corrective
    - The storm after, apply after event has happened, to reverse impact of said event to working state.
    - Corrects the problem that has happened
    - Restoring back ups
    - Creates policies to report security issues
- Compensating
    - If something isn't working, use this instead. Often temporary. Instead of a passcode, you use a physical key instead to get into your Tesla.
    - Firewalls block application instead of patching the application if there is an exploitable bug. Using a generator if there is a power outage to prevent access.
- Directive
    - Directs subject towards compliance
    - Sign that says "Authroized Personnel Only"
    - Very weak sense of security control since there is no enforcement.
